# Plant Seedlings Classification🌱
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages. So, Plant Seedlings Classification is one of a competition in Kaggle which aims to determine the species of a seedling from an image.

<br> We've use <b>InceptionResNetV2</b> in this model to determine each pictures for main model and after that we've <b>flatten and dense the main model</b> and finally we've got score of model for <b>0.97229</b> (calculated by Kaggle)
